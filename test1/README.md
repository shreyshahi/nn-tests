Test 1: Modeling X^2
---------------------

Here we want to test the generalization capabilities of a deep neural network. We will try to train neural networks to fit a simple function such as X^2 using data from the range [-2, 1) U (1, 2] and then evaluate the network on test data from range [-1, 1]. We will compare results from different depths (number of hidden layers), nonlinearities, and regularization shemes.
